Neurons are specialized cells that can receive, process, and transmit electrical and chemical signals. They are the building blocks of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves, playing a critical role in enabling communication both within the nervous system and between the nervous system and other parts of the body. Neurons typically have a cell body, dendrites to receive signals, an axon to transmit signals, and synapses to connect with other neurons.
